# Google-Docs-Clone

This Project is a clone of Google Docs.

It uses HTML, CSS, BootStrap, PHP, MySQL as a Database and JQuery.

This project has a login and a signup page where the user can create an new account or login.

Once the user logs in, They are given a blank document to type on

and everything that they type will be stored in the database immediately without even pressing a save button.

The user can logout and come back to find what they typed still exists as we pull it from the database.

but if they do not logout, with the use of cookies, they dont need to login everytime.
